/**
 * Although `TestContext` is an internal data structure it is not in the internal package because it was used publicly
 * in the v1 API. From v2 on `TestContext` is only used internally.
 *
 * API v1 doesn't require the use of `TestContext` directly, so it is considered _internal_ since then. Nonetheless it's
 * not annotated with [InternalSweetestApi] because v1 tests still depend on it.
 *
 * TestContext can hold an arbitrary number of [TestContextElement]s. It creates an instance if it has not already.
 * There can only be one instance per type. [TestContextElement.Key] is here for type-safe, reflection-free
 * instantiation of a specific subtype of [TestContextElement].

 * - Even if used as a constructor argument for steps classes in v1 â€“ it's ignored!
