## Goals

* Put a **layer of abstraction** on the system under test: we call these abstractions _steps_ (as derived from Cucumber[^cucumber])
  * so if the system changes, the test system doesn't need to change
  * so the test just tells _what_ is tested, not _how_ (tests become more business-centric, whenever possible)
  * so there is a proper separation of concerns (separation of business rules, workflow and technical implementation)
*
